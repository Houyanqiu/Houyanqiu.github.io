# Hobbies

This page is a little snapshot of my creative world, which I’ve been diving into more deeply over the past year. I’ve fallen in love with crocheting and pixel bead art, two hobbies that let my hands dance and my mind wander. If you’re around and fancy crafting together—or just want to chat about yarn and beads—drop me a line at houyanqiu2003@163.com!

## Crocheting

<br>There’s something magical about turning a simple strand of yarn into a cozy scarf, a quirky hat, or even a tiny plush toy. Crocheting feels like weaving little stories with every stitch—each loop a moment of calm, each pattern a burst of joy. I adore the rhythm of the hook gliding through the yarn, transforming chaos into order. Recently, I’ve been experimenting with colorful blankets inspired by the vibrant landscapes of my hometown in Sichuan’s Tibetan region.

## Pixel Bead Art

<br>Pixel bead art is my tiny universe of color and precision. With every bead I place, it’s like painting with dots—building miniature masterpieces that sparkle under the light. Whether it’s a cute animal, a intricate mandala, or a scene from a favorite memory, I lose myself in the click-clack of beads lining up perfectly. It’s oddly satisfying, like solving a puzzle that ends in a burst of beauty. My latest project? A pixelated portrait of a mountain sunset—tedious, but oh-so-rewarding!

## Past Hobbies

I used to spend hours hiking through the hills near my hometown, sketching landscapes, and binge-watching documentaries about public health innovations. Lately, though, my hooks and beads have taken over my free time.

## My Dream Craft Corner

One day, I’d love to have a cozy little craft nook filled with yarn in every shade and beads of every size—a space where I can create, dream, and maybe even teach others the joy of crafting.
